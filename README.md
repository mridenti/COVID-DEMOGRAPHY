# COVID-DEMOGRAPHY
Compartimental model for studying the impact of COVID over distinct demography profiles and contact patters

To run the simulation, just run the python script scenario_explore.py from its location. 
If the C project have to be recompiled, just check the instructions on https://github.com/mridenti/COVID-19-ITA-WIN 

The input files for the cript scenario_explore.py produce the results reported in the article "Mathematical modeling and investigation on the role of demography and contact patterns in social distancing measures effectiveness in COVID-19 dissemination", published in the journal Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA, in 11 November 2022. 

A version of this article prior to the peer review process is available at the Arxiv repository https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05174.
